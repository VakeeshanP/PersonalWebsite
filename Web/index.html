        <p>I completed the iCET Certified Developer Program from 2022 to 2023, 
            and it was an amazing learning experience. I had the opportunity to

            The program covered Java, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, MySQL, JavaScript, 
            React, MongoDB, and REST APIs. The teaching methods were truly exceptional,

        <h2>Institute of Java and Software Engineering</h2>
        
        <p>I completed the Comprehensive Master Java Developer Program at the 
            Institute of Java and Software Engineering from 2021 to 2022.

        <p>I completed my Advanced Level studies in the Biology stream at Vidyananda College 
        from 2013 to 2015. Unfortunately, I passed Chemistry with a grade of C and 
        Physics with an S, but I faced challenges in Biology, which resulted in an 
        unsuccessful attempt. However, these experiences taught me valuable lessons, and I learned from my 
        mistakes.

            This village school was like a second home to me, with the freedom to learn 
            and grow. I enjoyed the company of friendly teachers, engaging in fun cultural 
            programs, and participating in various sports activities. This period of my 
            life at Kulavisuddan G.T.M School was one of the happiest times I have ever 
            experienced. Unfortunately, due to the onset of a country's war, my family and 
            I had to relocate to another town for safety reasons. This is when I joined 
            Pramandu Vidyalaya, and my educational journey continued from 2000 to 2008.

    <h1 id="Education">My Journey</h1>
    <h2>University of Colombo School of Computing</h3>
    <p>An external undergraduate student of Bachelor Information Technology, since November 2023.</p>
   
    <h2>Institute of Computer Engineering Technology</h2>
    <p>I completed the iCET Certified Developer Program from 2022 to 2023, 
        and it was an amazing learning experience. I had the opportunity to 
        delve into a diverse range of technologies and programming languages. 
        The program covered Java, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, MySQL, JavaScript, 
        React, MongoDB, and REST APIs. The teaching methods were truly exceptional, 
        thanks to the outstanding lectures and educators. I am sincerely grateful for 
        this valuable learning journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Institute of Java and Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>I completed the Comprehensive Master Java Developer Program at the 
        Institute of Java and Software Engineering from 2021 to 2022. 
        This program offered excellent modules that helped me master the 
        Java language thoroughly. It was a valuable and well-structured learning 
        experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Vidyananda Collage - National School</h2>
    <p>I completed my Advanced Level studies in the Biology stream at Vidyananda College 
        from 2013 to 2015. Unfortunately, I passed Chemistry with a grade of C and 
        Physics with an S, but I faced challenges in Biology, which resulted in an 
        unsuccessful attempt. However, these experiences taught me valuable lessons, and I learned from my 
        mistakes.
    </p>

    <h2>Pramandu Vidyalaya</h2>
    <p>I completed my Ordinary Level education at Pramandu Vidyalaya, 
        and I am delighted to report that I passed all my subjects with excellent 
        results. The time I spent at the school was filled with unforgettable fun 
        and sweet memories. This period of my life took place from 2010 to 2012.
    </p>

    <h2>Kulavisuddan G T M School</h2>
    <p>I commenced my educational journey at Kulavisuddan G.T.M School, 
        where I began my pre-school life and continued until I reached grade 7. 
        This village school was like a second home to me, with the freedom to learn 
        and grow. I enjoyed the company of friendly teachers, engaging in fun cultural 
        programs, and participating in various sports activities. This period of my 
        life at Kulavisuddan G.T.M School was one of the happiest times I have ever 
        experienced. Unfortunately, due to the onset of a country's war, my family and 
        I had to relocate to another town for safety reasons. This is when I joined 
        Pramandu Vidyalaya, and my educational journey continued from 2000 to 2008.
